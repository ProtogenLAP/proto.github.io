        This report intends to observe whether there is a correlation between the choice
        of an area in which to take up residence and whether this is the optimal choice
        in relation to commercial activities and the response of the public authorities to

        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p>
            Turin has a two-thousand-year history and was the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy.
            Since the second half of the twentieth century it has experienced a significant expansion of
            the urban morphology and is considered one of the major Italian production centers.
            Internal migrations in the second half of the twentieth century and subsequent
            ones from other foreign states have further modified the social pattern of the city.

            Turin is divided into 8 Districts that do not correspond to its historic districts and
            rises on the plain bordered by its 4 rivers; the Po "divides" the city into the
            south-north axis, delimiting the flat part of the city to the west and the
            hilly part to the east. The city is characterized by a checkerboard road network
            and has long tree-lined avenues of nineteenth-century origin.

            In the most recent history of the city, Turin has had to go through critical
            phases aggravated by the world economic recession of the second half of the 2000s,
            despite receiving a slightly favorable boost during the XX Winter Olympic Games and the
            IX Paralympic Winter Games in 2006. The Turin economic crisis, also aggravated by that
            of its major automotive industry, forced the shift of economic activities towards the
            secondary and tertiary sector, inaugurating a season of revaluation of fairs and cultural
            events, museums and art centers and important public works (such as the underground
            Metro or the railway link).
        </p>

        <h3 id="problem">Problem Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Despite this attempt to revive the city, some areas nevertheless remain distant from the model
            that every city government tries to achieve. The most striking examples are the eternal conflict
            between the center and the suburbs, the problems caused by traffic that makes the city
            one of the most polluted in Italy or the problems caused by the "nightlife" due to a
            concentration of clubs, pubs in some urban areas.

            It is appropriate to understand what are the real estate market trends in relation to the
            expansion of the tertiary sector, which appears to be dominated by commercial activities
            that have replaced the classic local shops and which causes considerable civic problems
            in some central and historic areas of the city. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand
            the extent of the public authority and its sanctioning system in relation to the reports
            made by affected citizens, especially in areas frequented by young people where noisy or
            general incivility actions often occur.
        </p>

        <h3 id="target">Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The idea of this report is to help people who are planning to relocate or find a new home in
            Turin to consider the best option for a quiet residence in the central or semi-central or
            hill areas near the Po river (<em>precollina</em>) possibly close to public parks and easily
            accessible by public transport.

            But are these areas really recommended for a possible stakeholder with these needs?
            The essential question is: are there islands of tranquility? And what is the response
            of public institutions to the phenomena of disturbances and incivility in certain areas?
        </p>

        <h3 id="solution">Possible Solution</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this report is to demonstrate whether there are alternatives and whether there is
            an impact in relocation choices in certain city areas.
        </p>

        <h2 id="data-src">Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The data essentially comes from sources of the Public Administration updated up to 2019.

            The complete dataset for the analysis consists of:

            datasets that contain the list of districts, zones, areas;
            the Revenue Agency dataset containing Residential and Commercial Land Value;
            a dataset from Local Police low crime rate (received petition and reports for disorderly conduct);
            the local Commercial Activities dataset in conjunction with Foursquare.

            The data format is provided in <em>csv/excel, geojson or geospatial</em> format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data Sources:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://geoportale.comune.torino.it">Geoportale Torino</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://geoportale.comune.torino.it/geocatalogocoto/?sezione=catalogo">Geoportale Torino
                    Catalog</a></li>

                <li><a href="http://aperto.comune.torino.it">Open Data Torino</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://wwwt.agenziaentrate.gov.it/servizi/Consultazione/ricerca.htm">Agenzia Entrate OMI</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare API</a></li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            First, it is necessary to <em>normalize</em> data as they contains a possibly obsolete geocoding
            format. For this reason the Python <em>GeoPandas</em> library<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
            is used as it extends the <em>pandas</em> datatypes with geospatial features in order to convert the
            original data in Latitude and Longitude.

            Some dataset contains the geographic information relating to the districts of the City of Turin,
            geo-referenced according to the <em>WGS84</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> coordinate system
            <em>EPSG: 4326</em> or <em>Monte Mario / Italy zone 1 (EPSG: 3003)</em>.
            In the second case the coordinates are converted into the <em>WGS84 system</em>.

            For a quick visualization of places of attraction such as restaurants or squares for example,
            the <em>Foursquare API</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> is incorporated with data from other
            datasets.
        </p>

        <p>
            OMI Zones are a sub-zoning of main Districts and they are compiled by The Revenue Agency
            or Agenzia delle Entrate, an italian non-economic public body that collect taxes and also
            provides cadastral and geocartography services.
            OMI is the acronym of Osservatorio Mercato Immobiliare that provides cadastral and land
            registry queries for individuals and professionals. This service provides cadastral and
            land registry data bases, plans, incomes, class and typology, zones for each cities in the country.
            The survey sources are: real estate agencies, internal agency estimates, auctions, deeds of sale,
            courts, etc.

            OMI files can be obtained and exported in <em>zip</em> format and contain:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 CSV: Value and Zone listing with zoning, residential, commercial,
                    min and max prices for property and lease, status, typology;</li>
                <li>1 KML file with zone coordinates defining zone, micro-zones, macro-zones,
                    zone description.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Zones are grouped in 4 Macro Areas (Fascia):
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>B: </strong>Central area</li>
                <li><strong>C: </strong>Semi-central neighbourhoods</li>
                <li><strong>D: </strong>Outskirts neighbourhoods</li>
                <li><strong>E: </strong>Hills area</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Local administration counts <strong>8 Districts</strong> now, while in some open data still
            counts 10.
            In recent years two districts have been merged with others: Districts 8 and 9 were merged
            into District 8; Districts 2 and 10 were merged into District 2.
        </p>


        <h3 id="op-notes">Operational Notes</h3>
        <p>
            All Data Sources are <strong>pre-Covid</strong>. The Report does not consider the year 2020 and the Covid
            <em>variable</em> although some private reports<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> state that the
            real estate market has not yet suffered
            significant decline.

            Some datasets needed to be cleaned up before they could be used due to the use of
            different character encodings (non UTF-8), different formats.

            Other datasets seem incomplete or present missing data across the years, and in the worst case seem wrong.
            Especially it seems that the public authority uses different methodology to locate street and Districts.

            All dataframes labels are in original language. See Table Translation as references below.

            In this report, central and semi-central zones in <em>normal</em> state have been selected.

        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            A different methodology was applied for each part analyzed.
            From preliminary exploration of the zones to clustering for commercial activities.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first part of the report did not need any particular approach as it was
            just a matter of selecting an area and then applying the averages to understand
            how the market has moved over the years. Anyway a Clustering approach has been applied.
            In summary, it was imagined starting from the initial demand of a possible buyer to
            search for a prestigious area and apply the analysis taking into account the average
            prices of the area and select the areas excluding the maximums and minimums that in
            certain areas represent the outliers.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the second part of the report concerning Commercial Activities, it was necessary
            to use a <em>k-mean clustering</em> approach to understand the relationships between the various
            <em>Districts</em> of the City and to understand what is the phenomenon of the tertiary sector
            and if there are any components that can indicate which areas are more similar to others.
            n this case it was necessary to start from a preliminary analysis using the Foursquare API to
            understand which areas have the most commercial services available in certain categories.
            In this case, the categories of Restaurants and Cafes were excluded from the survey, mainly
            using data relating to night clubs, concerts, events. However, the data seemed rather scarce
            and not exactly up to date, so it was also necessary to use the official data from public
            sources updated to 2019, exceeding the search limits of the supplier.
            As for the Foursquare API, the k-mean clustering approach was applied excluding some
            commercial activities. However, it was not possible to discern the specific categories as
            they were not specified in the original dataset. So we proceeded by analyzing the data to
            select an entire category (EP) including all commercial activities relating to bars, restaurants,
            discos and public places in general.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the third part, relating to the repression by the public authority of incivility and abuse
            phenomena in certain areas, a simple regression was used considering the number of reports
            and the number of notifications issued as values.
        </p>


        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the results of the analysis
        </p>

        <h3 id="zone-exp">Zone Exploration</h3>

        <h3 id="commercial-exp">Commercial Exploration</h3>
        <p>
            The commercial areas especially belonging to the <em>EP</em> (Public Places) category have increased since
            the second half of the 2000s.
            <br>
            In particular, there is an increase after 2012, presumably caused by the national policy of economic
            <em>Liberalization</em> following the global economic crisis. This policy - in a nutshell - has in fact
            "unlocked" the previous one in which the local market was in some way bound by rules that prevented
            the opening of commercial establishments too close to each other.
            <br>
            Obviously the central areas are better served than the peripheral ones and concentrate the greatest
            number of commercial activities to serve not only the resident population but also offices and tourists.
        </p>

        <p>
            This map shows the concentration of public places throughout the city and in relation to the areas
            selected with a black border. The most impacted areas are <strong>B2, B5, B7</strong> with a greater
            exposure for the <strong>B8</strong> area. Especially in the areas more marked with the red color
            there are night clubs, cocktail bars, restaurants and correspond to the classic areas of nocturnal
            concentration and are the most problematic for civil coexistence.

        <h3 id="pa-exp">Public Authority Exploration</h3>

        <h4>Public Authority and Contact Center</h4>
        <p>
            This observation shows the most problematic areas of the city considering the level of Infringement
            Notifications issued by the public authority to suppress the phenomena of harassment, shouting, noise
            from public places, too much music volume, high concentrations of people, etc. In general, it can be said
            that the higher the concentration of public places, the higher the incivility phenomenon, especially at
            night. There is a geographical correspondence of the phenomenon especially in the selected and more
            central areas.
            Macro-zone <em>B</em>, which corresponds with its selected zones in the observation to Districts 1 and 8,
            is clearly the most impacted due to the high number of concentration of public nightclubs, bars,
            restaurants.
            <br>
            The phenomenon extends to neighboring areas and elsewhere, but the level of concentration in this case is
            relatively low and attributable to harassing behavior in its own right rather than to the concentration
            of people.
            <br>
            The data available from 2011 to the second quarter of 2019 were analyzed. For the unavailable data,
            the average was applied taking into account the previous years. The missing data refer to the second
            half of 2019.
            <br>
            Considering the years from 2011 to 2019, there is a decrease in the number of penalties applied.
            Observing the available data, it can be seen that from 2011 to 2014 the control was tighter, while from
            2015 to 2018 the type of control diversified and became more relaxed.
            <br>
            The 5 major categories of abuse or misconduct are taken as examples in the table.
            The type <em>FORBIDDEN CONDUCT</em> refers to the behavior of people, including their behavior outside
            the premises, while the other types are sanctions applied to public premises.

            This is the relationship between Infringements and the most "hot" periods of the year. It is possible to
            note that the months of August (mid-summer) and December (mid-winter) are generally the least affected by
            the production of notifications and sanctions, while the months in which the most checks occur are spring
            and autumn.

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            In this observation, the relationship between commercial activities, nightlife and public force
            intervention to repress and / or keep under control the phenomena of incivility and bad behavior caused
            by the increase in entertainment venues was analyzed.
            It has been shown that where the concentration is high, the phenomenon of incivility is more evident and
            marked. Furthermore, some Districts suffer more from the bad habits of uncivilized citizens, whether
            they are customers or managers of public places. Obligations are also imposed on the latter to maintain
            control of their customers.
            <br>
            In addition, there are numerous non-compliance with the regulations and the lack of licenses by the
            operators of the sector, as well as the same agreements made with the residents of certain areas.
            <br>
            Over time, the public authority has had to counteract the phenomenon of bad nightlife with specific
            ordinances, limiting in certain cases operating hours, up to the closure for a certain period of some
            commercial activities due to repeated violations or noise emitted with loud or music, manifesting inability
            to manage customers. However, the number of violations of the regulations is considerable when compared to
            the population of the city and the phenomenon is often dealt with in local news.
            <br>
            Last but not least, petitions and complaints against local public bodies for omission or inability
            to limit the noise that occurs in certain areas and at certain times.
            <br>
            In the report it was not possible to use the most recent data as they were not yet produced by the
            institutions, so the pre-Covid period was only taken into consideration, limited to 2019. Following the
            prolonged lockdown, the Municipality decided to "help" the public places (closed for months) allowing the
            possibility of expanding one's business to the outside, on a public street through the installation
            of "temporary" dehors, at zero cost. This ordinance was followed by an additional incentive practice by
            establishing new pedestrian areas near public places. All to the detriment of the residents, with traffic
            and parking problems that are added to the already known problems of incivility.
            <br>
            Having analyzed the phenomenon starting from the initial question on the selection of a central area
            in which to take up residence, it was necessary to understand if there are other factors to determine a
            bad choice for the future and which must be taken into account.
            <br>
            In general, it could be said that the central areas are undoubtedly the most popular because they
            have more services and are the best served, on the other hand they are also the least quiet,
            especially on weekends. But this is not the case in all areas. Some are islands of tranquility - in
            relation to the available data and not only to personal subjectivity - but clearly at a price sometimes
            higher than the average of the real estate market.
            <br>
            Finally, from the selected areas, those where human and nocturnal recreational activity is most
            concentrated can be excluded: B8, followed by B7, part of B2 and B5. The hilly areas and along
            the River Po south of the center and west of it remain quiet areas.
        </p>


        <h2 id="suggestion">Suggestions and Directions</h2>
        <p>
            In this report some variables have not been considered such as the resident population for each area,
            the quality of transport and services, traffic, but above all the part relating to the transfer of
            commercial activities and what is the relevance on the socio-economic factor of the City.
            <br>
            In the future, it may be necessary to use and compare the data following the Covid pandemic
            and subsequent municipal ordinances to verify promptly whether they have positively or negatively
            affected the resident population.
